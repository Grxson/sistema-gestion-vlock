# Core Rules

- Always align with the user's intent before executing actions.
- Never delete or overwrite files without confirmation.
- Avoid assumptions; request clarification if something is ambiguous.
- Do not modify or access files outside the project workspace.
- Keep responses short, technical, and contextually relevant.
- Focus on maintainability, scalability, and clarity.
